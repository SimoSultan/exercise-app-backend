## Contributing
1. Create a new branch off of `main` (unless it's a simple change - then committing/pushing straight to `main` should be fine, just keep the commits tidy).
2. Write code.
3. Create a PR and post it in Discord. We aren't enforcing approvals, but just get it sanity checked if it's a big / risky change.
4. Squash and merge.
5. Merges to `main` will automatically deploy to Heroku.

## Installation
### DB Setup
1. [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
   
#### Windows/WSL2
2. Follow [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database#install-postgresql). Postgres will not run locally on WSL 1.
3. Install an SQL client of your choice - I use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) for Windows.
4. Start the Postgres server (probably via your CLI). For WSL the command is `sudo service postgresql start`. If you use another OS, add your instructions here.
5. Connect to your Postgres server via your SQL client.
   * Note: If you run into the error `FATAL: password authentication failed for user "postgres"` follow [these steps](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55039419).

#### MacOS
2. Simon downloaded the PostgreSQL installer (v. 14.4-1 at time of writing).
3. Used default settings in the installer but set my own password. This will install pgAdmin4 by default.
4. After installed, open pgAdmin4 and enter your password and create our DB with next step.
5. Using the pgAdmin4 browser on the left, click (Servers -> PostgreSQL 14 -> Databases -> 'postgres'). The query tool in the toolbar should now be black, (DB icon with a play button).
6. Create the DB by copy pasting in the `database/migrations/000001-create-database.sql` command into the Query and press Play icon.
7. Right click 'Databases' in the browser and 'refresh'. You should now see `exercise-app` in the list.

#### Connect BE to DB
1. Now add your password to the `.env` with `POSTGRES_PASSWORD="insert-your-password-here"`.
2. Start the BE server `npm start` and it should connect.
3. Run the queries inside `/database/migrations` in ascending order.
    * Note: You'll likely have to create the database (very first migration file) and then reconnect to that database before running the other queries.
. OPTIONAL: Insert a test user using the `/database/helpers/insert-user.sql` query. When the app is running (instructions below), you can verify the DB connection by accessing `localhost:5000/users` and your test user should come back as a JSON object. 


### App Setup
1. `git clone git@github.com:reezy24/exercise-app-backend.git`
2. `cd exercise-app-backend`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Check the app is running at `localhost:5000/ping`.

### Heroku Setup (Optional)
You only need to do this if you want to:
- connect to the live DB instance
- deploy a branch other than `main`

Any merges to `main` branch will automatically deploy to Heroku, i.e. you don't need to follow these steps in order to deploy your changes.

#### Steps
1. Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
2. `cd` into the root of the project if you aren't already.
3. `heroku git:remote -a exercise-app-backend-420`

#### How to Connect to the Live DB (Heroku Postgres)
1. `heroku pg:credentials:url DATABASE --app exercise-app-backend-420`
2. It should output connection details under `Connection info string`. You can use these to connect via your SQL client.

#### How to Deploy a Branch Other Than Main
NOTE: You should probably notify the Discord if you're going to do this.

1. Commit your changes to `your-branch`.
1. `git push heroku your-branch:main`

## Routes
### `GET /ping`
Sends back "pong".

### `POST /echo`
Sends back the request.

### `GET /users`
Lists users.
